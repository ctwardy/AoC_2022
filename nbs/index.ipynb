    "Wait! It's December already?  OK, just write Python using nano and commandline. That wasn't so bad. I'm not fast, but it was straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors\n",
    "OK, installed the new nbdev.  Used `str.translate` to change from ABC to RPS. In Part 2 that needed an extra step to look at the opponents move, but strategy dictionary seemed an okay approach.\n",

    "## Day 3: Rucksack Reorg\n",
    "Learning more nbdev features like docments and code-folding.  I think docments make the function declaration slightly uglier, but the generated docs are amazing. Worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming**: got to use `functools.reduce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nbdev**: Local docs were pretty easy. Spent _hours_ troubleshooting on GitHub.  Docs didn't like index.ipynb using `../data/` for file location. Solved by making `nbs/data -> ../data` and then referring to `data/`.  Later saw this in the docs:\n",

    "Was able to follow the Day 3 nbdev template. Solution was straightforward, but all told still me a bit more than an hour.  Hm. Over 90 minutes after adding this section to the README (index.ipynb). Nbdev makes documentation tempting. That's not necessarily a bad thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Nbdev**: `nbdev_prep` caught a leftover day3 cell at the bottom of my day4 notebook. Cool. But after fixing, the running preview still didn't have day4. But stopping and re-running did.  Guess that's a thing. \n",

    "## Day 5: Supply Stacks\n",
    "This took me surprisingly long. I had the example parsed in 45 minutes, but then realized `move()` would be easier with stacks, and iterating on that entered a regress.  Once the example ran, Part 1 followed with one tweak, then Part 2 needed only a quick rewrite of `move()`.  \n",

    "3. GH still using 3.9, which now failed to satisfy min version.\n",
    "4. Changed `setup.py` to force 3.10.  Same error. \n",

    "6. Go back to min of 3.8, and use `from __future__ import annotations`. Supposed to work.  Same error.\n",
