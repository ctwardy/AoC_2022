AoC_2022
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is my first year of AoC, and I’ve decided to use it to practice
with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) to automatically generate modules
and documentation from my notebooks.

I’ll probably evolve my organization as I go. I did Day 1 with a regular
python module and that made sense to put each day in its own folder with
data as `input.txt`. But I think with nbdev it makes sense to have the
usual `nbs` folder for all the notebooks, one per day. In that case I’ll
put the data in `data/dayX_input.txt`. Like so:

``` python
!ls ../data
```

    day2_input.txt

## Install

``` sh
pip install AoC_2022
```

## How to use

You should then be able to import the desired module and run it.

TBD: standardize the data input so each day has the same command.

TBD: and maybe just a `.run` method or something

``` python
from AoC_2022.day2 import *

with open("../data/day2_input.txt") as f:
    data = [rps_decode(x.strip()) for x in f.readlines()]
score_strategy(data)
```
