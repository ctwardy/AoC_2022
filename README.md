AoC_2022
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This is my first year of AoC, and I’ve decided to use it to practice
with [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai) to automatically generate modules
and [documentation](https://ctwardy.github.io/AoC_2022/) from my
notebooks.

I’ll probably evolve my organization as I go. I did Day 1 with a regular
python module and that made sense to put each day in its own folder with
data as `input.txt`. But I think with nbdev it makes sense to have the
usual `nbs` folder for all the notebooks, one per day. In that case I’ll
put the data in `data/dayX_input.txt`. Like so:

``` python
!ls ../data
```

    day2_input.txt day3_input.txt

## Install

There’s no reason to install this, so we’re not using nbdev’s ability to
automatically package for pip and conda. Probably you will just browse
the [documentation](https://ctwardy.github.io/AoC_2022/) or [view the
code](https://github.com/ctwardy/AoC_2022) in GitHub. Of course you
could `git pull` the code yourself if you want. If using https that
would be:

``` shell
git pull https://github.com/ctwardy/AoC_2022.git
```

If using the git CLI that would be:

``` shell
gh repo clone ctwardy/AoC_2022.git
```

## How to use

All functions are exported to the `AoC_2022` package.

1.  Install the package locally.

``` shell
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

2.  Import the desired module and use its functions.

For example:

``` python
from AoC_2022.day2 import *

with open("data/day2_input.txt") as f:
    data = [rps_decode(x.strip()) for x in f.readlines()]
score_strategy(data)
```
